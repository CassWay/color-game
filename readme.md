# Color Game 

### from **[The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)** by *Colt Steele*. 


>This project was built with vanilla **javaScript,** basic **HTML & CSS**. 
>The purpose of this Color Game is to Identify the Color based on the RGB color values. 

## The javaScript involved using: 

 - various functionality and usages of for loops  
    - *for (var i = 0; i < num; i++)* ;
 - if / else statements ;
 - arrays --> *arr.push* ; 
 - Math  --> *Math.floor* ; *Math.round* 


>Ths was a fun project to build and see how the concepts tie together, as well as creating a playable game for the browser.
